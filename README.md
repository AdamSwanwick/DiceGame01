Rolled Dice Game 
I have made a very basic start to the dice game, i have created a class of dice, a button and a basic dice rolled function that will output a random number between 1 and 6, a this point none of it links together with any mouse pressed or listener functions but just thought i wold show what i have put togetgher so far
